    "content": "The 22nd International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2025)\nwill take place from 14 July to 18 July 2025 in Varna, Bulgaria.  Quantum\nPhysics and Logic is an annual conference that brings together academic and\nindustry researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum\ncomputation, quantum physics, and related areas. The main focus is on the use\nof algebraic and categorical structures, formal languages, type systems,\nlogics, semantic methods, as well as other mathematical and computer scientific\ntechniques applicable to the study of physical systems, physical processes, and\ntheir composition.\n\nImportant Dates\n\n\n  Abstract submission deadline: TBA\n  Paper submission deadline: TBA\n  Notification: TBA\n  Camera-ready deadline: TBA\n  Conference: 14 July – 18 July 2025\n\n\nAll deadlines are stated with respect to the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone.\n\nSubmissions\n\nProspective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the following:\n\n\n  Proceedings submission. This consists of a 5-12 page paper.

This consists of a 3 page summary, together with\na link to a separate published paper or preprint. If the published paper or\npreprint is not publicly available (e.g. not open access), then it should be\nincluded in full after the summary.\n  Poster submission.

Authors of accepted poster submissions will be invited to present\ntheir work at the poster session.\n\nThe conference program will be announced later.\n\nConference Proceedings\n\nConference proceedings will be published in Electronic Proceedings in\nTheoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) after the\nconference. When preparing the final version for publication, authors of\naccepted proceedings submissions are allowed to use up to three extra pages\n(i.e. up to 15 pages excluding bibliography) to address reviewer concerns and\nsuggestions under the provisio that they do not introduce new results.\n\nLocal Information\n\nThe conference will take place at the Rosslyn Dimyat Hotel in Varna, Bulgaria.\n\n\n\nMore local information will be provided later.\n\nProgramme Committee Co-chairs\n\n\n  Alejandro Díaz-Caro (Universidad Nacional de Quilmes &amp; ICC (CONICET / Universidad de Buenos Aires))\n  Ognyan Oreshkov (Université libre de Bruxelles)\n  Ana Belén Sainz (ICTQT, University of Gdansk)\n\n\nProgramme Committee\n\nTBA\n\nOrganising Committee\n\n\n  Timothée Hoffreumon (Inria, France)\n  Ognyan Oreshkov (Université libre de Bruxelles, Belgium)\n  Vladimir Zamdzhiev      (Inria, France)\n\n\nFeel free to email Vladimir Zamdzhiev {first.last at inria dot fr} with any questions or concerns.\n\nQPL Steering Committee\n\n\n  Bob Coecke (Quantinuum)\n  Ana Belén Sainz (ICTQT, University of Gdansk)\n  Peter Selinger (Dalhousie University)\n\n\nPrevious QPL Editions\n\nAn archive of all previous QPL editions is available.\n",
