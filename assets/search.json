Quantum\nPhysics and Logic is an annual conference that brings together academic and\nindustry researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum\ncomputation, quantum physics, and related areas. The main focus is on the use\nof algebraic and categorical structures, formal languages, type systems,\nlogics, semantic methods, as well as other mathematical and computer scientific\ntechniques applicable to the study of physical systems, physical processes, and\ntheir composition. Work applying quantum-inspired techniques and structures to\nother fields, such as linguistics, artificial intelligence, and causality, is\nalso welcome.\n\nImportant Dates\n\n\n  Abstract submission deadline: 9 February 2025\n  Paper submission deadline: 16 February 2025\n  Notification: 24 March 2025\n  Camera-ready deadline (revised accepted proceedings manuscripts): 15 June 2025\n  Conference: 14 July – 18 July 2025\n\n\nAll deadlines are stated with respect to the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone.\n\nSubmissions\n\nProspective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the following:\n\n\n  Proceedings submission. This consists of a 5-12 page paper. It must\nprovide sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest, in sufficient\ndetail for the program committee to assess the merits of the work.\nProceedings submissions must use\nthe EPTCS style files.\n  Talk proposal. This consists of a 3 page summary, together with\na link to a separate published paper or preprint. If the published paper or\npreprint is not publicly available (e.g. not open access), then it should be\nincluded in full after the summary.\n  Poster submission. This consists of a 3 page summary of partial results or\nwork in progress.\n\n\nPage limits exclude bibliography and appendices (which may be read at the\ndiscretion of reviewers). All submissions will be handled by EasyChair.\nSubmit here.\n\nThere will be an award for Best Student Paper that will be determined by the\nProgram Committee. Papers eligible for the award are those where all the\nauthors are students at the time of submission.\n\nRegistration\n\nRegistration is not open yet.\n\nPresentations\n\nAuthors of accepted proceedings and non-proceedings submissions will be invited\nto give a talk. Authors of accepted poster submissions will be invited to present\ntheir work at the poster session.\n\nThe conference program will be announced later.\n\nConference Proceedings\n\nConference proceedings will be published in Electronic Proceedings in\nTheoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) after the\nconference. When preparing the final version for publication, authors of\naccepted proceedings submissions are allowed to use up to three extra pages\n(i.e. up to 15 pages excluding bibliography) to address reviewer concerns and\nsuggestions under the proviso that they do not introduce new results.\n\nSpecial Edition\nIn addition to the proceedings, we are in discussions with JLAMP regarding a special issue; details will follow.\n\nContact\n\nFor inquiries related to the submission and review process, please write to the PC chairs at pcchairsqpl2025@gmail.com.\n\nFor inquiries related to the conference itself, please write to qpl.conference.2025@gmail.com.\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\n\n\n\n\nOrganisational Support and Funding\n\n\n\n\nProgramme Committee Co-chairs\n\n\n  Alejandro Díaz-Caro (Inria, LORIA &amp; Universidad Nacional de Quilmes)\n  Ognyan Oreshkov (Université libre de Bruxelles)\n  Ana Belén Sainz (ICTQT, University of Gdansk)\n\n\nProgramme Committee\n\n\n  Alastair Abbott\n  Pablo Arrighi\n  Miriam Backens\n  Rui Soares Barbosa\n  Ämin Baumeler\n  Jessica Bavaresco\n  Alessandro Bisio\n  Robert Booth\n  Cyril Branciard\n  Titouan Carette\n  Ulysse Chabaud\n  Giulio Chiribella\n  Bob Coecke\n  Marcelo Terra Cunha\n  Alejandro Díaz-Caro\n  Ross Duncan\n  Pierre-Emmanuel Emeriau\n  Flaminia Giacomini\n  Stefano Gogioso\n  Matty Hoban\n  Emmanuel Jeandel\n  Anna Jenčová\n  Robin Kaarsgaard\n  Martti Karvonen\n  Kohei Kishida\n  Aleks Kissinger\n  Ravi Kunjwal\n  Robin Lorenz\n  Glaucia Murta\n  Nuriya Nurgalieva\n  Ognyan Oreshkov\n  Anna Pearson\n  Simon Perdrix\n  Nicola Pinzani\n  Robert Rand\n  Neil Ross\n  Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh\n  Ana Belén Sainz\n  Nitica Sakharwade\n  Carlo Maria Scandolo\n  John Selby\n  Peter Selinger\n  Sonja Smets\n  Pawel Sobocinski\n  Isar Stubbe\n  Benoît Valiron\n  Augustin Vanrietvelde\n  Vilasini Venkatesh\n  Renaud Vilmart\n  Juliana Kaizer Vizzotto\n  Quanlong Wang\n  Julian Wechs\n  Mirjam Weilenmann\n  John van de Wetering\n  Alexander Wilce\n  Margherita Zorzi\n\n\nOrganising Committee\n\n\n  James Hefford (Inria, France)\n  Timothée Hoffreumon (Université Paris-Saclay, France)\n  Ognyan Oreshkov (Chair) (Université libre de Bruxelles, Belgium)\n  Eleftherios-Ermis Tselentis (Université libre de Bruxelles, Belgium)\n  Zixiuan Liu (Université libre de Bruxelles, Belgium)\n  Vladimir Zamdzhiev (Inria, France)\n\n\nQPL Steering Committee\n\n\n  Bob Coecke (Quantinuum)\n  Ana Belén Sainz (ICTQT, University of Gdansk)\n  Peter Selinger (Dalhousie University)\n\n\nPrevious QPL Editions\n\nAn archive of all previous QPL editions is available.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nPlease make this conference a welcoming space for everyone.
