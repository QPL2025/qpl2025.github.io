    "content": "The conference will take place at the Hotel Cherno More in Varna, Bulgaria.\n\n\n\nA map with the locations relevant to the conference:\n\n  Varna Museum of Archaeology, Wednesday 14h;\n  Restaurant Veranda Horizont (Conference Dinner), Thursday 19h\n\n\nis shown below.\n\n\n\nThe local currency is the Bulgarian Lev, BGN, with approximate exchange rate 1 EUR = 1.9558 BGN.\n\nConference Dinner\n\nAn official Conference Dinner is organised for the evening of Thursday, 17 July, at the restaurant Veranda, Club Horizont.\n\nMuseum Tour and Jazz Concert\n\nOn the afternoon of Wednesday 16 July there will be a guided tour of the Archeological Museum of Varna, which features the oldest gold treasure in the world (4600 - 4200 BC) discovered in the Varna Necropolis, as well as a jazz concert by Bulgarian musician Hristo Yotsov later in the evening in the yard of the museum.\n\nThe cost of these events is included in the conference registration fee.\n\nTravel Information\n\nHow to reach the conference venue:\n\n\n  from Varna Airport: detailed information available here. The public transport option is bus 409 (from Terminal 2) which stops close to the conference venue (stop Sevastopol).\n  from Varna Central Train Station: within walking distance, approximately 1.2km. You can also take buses 20 or 39 to stop “Festivalen Kompleks” or bus 31 for two stops to “Muzeya / The Museum”.\n  from Varna Central Bus Station: Bus 409 (stop Sevastopol). Or by walking (approximately 2.6km).\n\n\nTaxi is also an option. The biggest and most famous taxi company in the city is Triumf Taxi.\n\nThe weather is expected to be hot. Varna is on the seaside with several beaches not far from the conference venue.\n\nFood/Drink\n\nSome recommendations:\n\n\n  Stariya Chinar (Стария Чинар) - restaurant right at the base of Hotel Cherno More (conference venue). Some emphasis on traditional Bulgarian food.\n  Cubo — a beach bar where you can chill out, watch the sea, have a drink, listen to music. On certain nights they have a band.\n  Piano Bar Sinatra - on the top floor of Hotel Cherno More (conference venue). Nice view and convenient.\n  Cubo at Fisherman’s Beach – a restaurant at the beach. Interesting food options and drinks, pleasant music, cool atmosphere.\n  Nemo - restaurant (good sea food).\n  Burrata Italiana Varna - Italian style restaurant.\n  Captain Cook - seafood restaurant.\n  Mr. Baba - restaurant inside a wooden ship.\n  Happy - restaurant chain with many food options. Another one here.\n  Cherry by Marry – for cakes and coffee, very close to the venue.\n  Le Chef - fast food (wraps), just next to the venue.\n  Beach Bar Menthol - another beach bar.\n  There are other restaurants and bars along the seaside (close to the two Cubos linked above) and also at the Sea Port (“Morska Gara” / “Морска Гара”).\n\n\nPoints of Interest\n\nSome recommendations:\n\n\n  Dormition of the Mother of God Cathedral - Orthodox Cathedral (photo on the conference webpage).\n  The Sea Garden / Morska Gradina / Морска Градина - seaside park.\n\n\nAccommodation\n\nDuring the summer season, Varna becomes a busy tourist destination and finding accommodation may get difficult. We therefore advise booking your stay as early as possible. In general, we recommend booking accommodation in the city centre, or close to the sea in walking distance from the conference venue.\n\nWe have negotiated discounted prices for QPL participants at the hotels listed below. Prices are given in Bulgarian lev, or BGN, where 1 EUR = 1.9558 BGN.\n\n\n  Hotel Cherno More (conference venue)\n\n\nClassic room: single occupancy 158 BGN, double occupancy 185 BGN.\nDelux room: single occupancy 194 BGN, double occupancy 221 BGN (here, a third person could be added for an extra 50 BGN).\nExclusive room: single occupancy 221 BGN, double occupancy 248 BGN.\n\nThese prices include breakfast. You can get more information and make a booking using the codes below on the hotel website.\n\nRooms can be booked at the above rates for any duration in the period 13 – 19 July, conditional on availability, using the bonus code: QPL25.\n\nIn order to ensure some availability, 10 rooms of type Twin Classic (with two separate beds that could be brought next to each other if desired) and 20 rooms of type Twin Delux (with two separate beds that could be brought next each other if desired) have been blocked until 30 April for booking by QPL participants. They can be booked using the block code QPL25TCLS for a Twin Classic room, and the block code QPL25TDLX for a Twin Deluxe room. Each of these rooms can be reserved for single or double occupancy, and in the case of Twin Deluxe, a third person can be added.\n\nIf any of the blocked rooms have not been booked by 30 April, they will be open for booking by anyone, but QPL participants could still book them at the reduced prices with the bonus code QPL25 provided there is availability. Feel free to write to the hotel with further inquiries.\n\n\n  Hotel Rosslyn Dimyat Varna\n\n\nThis hotel is located a 16 minute walk from the conference venue, in front of the Sea Garden. It features spacious rooms with views over the sea, as well as access to fitness and spa.\n\nClassic room: single use 205.00 BGN.\nDeluxe sea view room: single use 225.00 BGN.\nExecutive room: high floor, sea view, single use 245.00 BGN.\nSurcharge for second adult in a Double room: 30.00 BGN per night \n\nThe prices include breakfast and complimentary use of the fitness and spa centre. You can book at these prices by writing to reservations.dimyat@rosslyn-hotels.com, specifying that you are participant at the conference and mentioning the code QPL2025. \n\n\n  Hotel Horizont (next to conference dinner, 25 minute walk from the conference venue)\n\n\nThis hotel is part of the Complex Hoizont, where we will have the conference dinner. It is located in a calm and green area in the Sea Garden, overlooking the sea and a few minutes from a beach.\n\nStandard double room: 140 BGN.\nDelux room: 210 BGN.\nSuite with hydrotherapy bath: 270 BGN.\n\nThese prices are available for reservations of 4 or more nights. Breakfast is not included. Guests can order breakfast at the associated restaurant Marché, but only after 9:00 am. To make a booking, please write to hotel@horizont.bg specifying that you are a QPL participant.\n\nPoster Instructions\n\nIdeally, posters should be printed on A0 size (84,1 cm x 118,9 cm) paper or similar material in portrait (vertical) orientation, leaving a 6 cm margin on the top and a 6 cm margin on the bottom within the A0 size. These margins are required because of the attachment mechanisms on the poster boards at our disposal, which use some of the space around the top and bottom edges and limit the vertical size of the visible area to 110 cm. The side (left and right) margins are not essential, but the total horizontal size should not exceed that of the A0 format (84,1 cm) so that the poster can enter the attachment mechanisms.\n\nPosters exceeding A0 size risk being unsuitable for the boards, so they should be strongly avoided. Smaller posters are OK, but they may have to be attached by tape.\n",
